<!-- # Docker Containers List

This file specifies the Docker containers to include for log collection. Format each container name as a Markdown list item:

- container-name-1
- container-name-2
- container-name-3

Replace `container-name-X` with the names of the containers you want to include. Ensure each name is on a new line and prefixed with a `-`. -->
